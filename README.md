# Cattle Disease Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze data related to cattle diseases. The primary goal is to build a model capable of classifying or predicting diseases based on available data, assisting farmers and veterinarians in making data-driven decisions.

---

## Dataset
### Description
- The dataset includes features related to cattle, such as:
  - Age
  - Weight
  - Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, etc.)
  - Observed symptoms

### Preprocessing
- Data cleaning to handle missing or outlier values.
- Encoding categorical features into numerical values.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing features using graphs and plots.
   - Examining relationships between independent variables and the target.
2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Cleaning data.
   - Handling missing values.
   - Splitting the dataset.
3. **Model Development:**
   - Experimenting with various algorithms such as:
     - Logistic Regression.
     - Random Forest.
     - Neural Networks.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Using metrics like:
     - Accuracy.
     - Confusion Matrix.
     - F1-Score.
